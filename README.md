# Superman
Superman is one of the most iconic and enduring superheroes in popular culture. Superman's powers include superhuman strength, speed, flight, invulnerability, heat vision, x-ray vision, and super-hearing, among others. His abilities are fueled by Earth's yellow sun, which gives him powers far beyond those of normal humans. Despite his incredible powers, he strives to remain humble, using his abilities to protect humanity from all manner of threats, ranging from criminal masterminds to alien invaders.
